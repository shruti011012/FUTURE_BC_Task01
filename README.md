# FUTURE-INTERNS-TASK-1
# Task 1 – Blockchain Basics

## Theory  
In this task, I studied how blockchain works: how transactions are requested, how blocks are created, how nodes validate, and how a block is added to the chain. I turned that theory into a fun, cartoon-style infographic to explain the flow in a visual manner.

## What I Did  
- Created a step-by-step infographic (cartoon style) showing how a blockchain processes transactions.  
- Made sure it’s simple and engaging so even non-technical people can follow.  
- Shared the infographic in my GitHub repository and in a LinkedIn post.

## Learnings & Reflection  
- I now understand the end-to-end lifecycle of a transaction in blockchain.  
- Visualising the process helped me internalize how nodes validate and consensus works.  
- This improved my ability to explain complex concepts simply.
